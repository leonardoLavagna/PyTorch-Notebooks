# PyTorch-Notebooks
Here we collect a series of notebooks to familiarize with some important data processing and analysis pipelines based on PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/).

### What's in here?
- Notebook_1 : Fundamentals
- Notebook_2 : Gradients, Optimizers and Loss Functions
- Notebook_3 : Standard workflow and Linear Regression
- Notebook_4 : Standard workflow and Logistic Regression
- Notebook_5 : Multiclass classification
- Notebook_6 : Neural Networks, Activation Functions and Digit Recognition
- Notebook_7 : Recurrent Neural Networks and Name Classification

To do:
- Notebook_8 : Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision 
- Notebook_9 : Application of Convolutional Neural Networks to an Image Recognition problem 
- Notebook_10 : Modularity and Transfer Learning 
- Notebook_11 : Application of Transfer Learning to a Computer Vision problem 
- Notebook_12 : Experiment tracking

### Datasets
All the datasets used are the standard ones available in PyTorch or in Scikit-Learn. The only exception is Notebook 7 wich uses custom data that can be found in the zipped folder `data.zip`.
