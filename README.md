# PyTorch-Notebooks
Here we collect a series of notebooks to familiarize with some important data processing and analysis pipelines based on PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/).

### What's in here?
- `Notebook_1.ipynb` : Fundamentals
- `Notebook_2.ipynb` : Gradients, Optimizers and Loss Functions
- `Notebook_3.ipynb` : Standard workflow and Linear Regression
- `Notebook_4.ipynb` : Standard workflow and Logistic Regression
- `Notebook_5.ipynb` : Multiclass classification
- `Notebook_6.ipynb` : Neural Networks, Activation Functions and Digit Recognition
- `Notebook_7.ipynb` : Recurrent Neural Networks and Name Classification
- `helper_functions.py`: Auxiliary functions needed in some of the previous notebooks

To do:
- Notebook_8 : Convolutional Neural Networks and Computer Vision 
- Notebook_9 : Application of Convolutional Neural Networks to an Image Recognition problem 
- Notebook_10 : Modularity and Transfer Learning 
- Notebook_11 : Application of Transfer Learning to a Computer Vision problem 
- Notebook_12 : Experiment tracking

### Datasets
All the datasets used are the standard ones available in PyTorch or in Scikit-Learn. The only exception is Notebook 7 wich uses custom data that can be found in the zipped folder `data.zip`.
